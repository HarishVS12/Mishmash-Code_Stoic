## üî• Project Description

Amid COVID_19 outbreak, Online education space has widened out. Conventional education has its own pros and cons but online education will play a major role in every individual's lives in the forthcoming years. 

What if a student requires to master just a topic from a large area of learning or What if a student requires a personal teacher to interact with and to learn that topic daily?

That's where MyTutor comes into play.

MyTutor is a mobile application which acts as a medium between a student and teacher (who might be a student) where a student will be taught by a teacher personally.

There are two separate apps for the teacher and the student. MyTutor for the students and MyStudent for the teachers.

 As a teacher, He/she could register and log in to the app. They could post their skills in which they think they are specialized for a reviewing process. The review process is to find whether the person is capable of teaching so that the quality doesn't get compromised. Once the review process gets over and if it is positive, they are allowed to post their resume on the app. The post also includes the hourly rate that the teacher charges. 

As a student, He/she could log in and search for the stuff that he/she wants to be taught. A list of resume of the teachers which matches the query gets displayed. The student could choose and appoint a teacher according to his/her preference. He/she should specify the start date, daily time and the number of sessions.

 A Video Chat interface is provided for both the teacher and the student to interact and share the knowledge daily at the specified time. The student has to transfer the money based on the hourly rate after a particular session so that the credibility is maintained.
